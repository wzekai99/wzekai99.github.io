I am an M.S. student in the School of Computer Science at Wuhan University, advised by Prof. [Weiwei Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/weiweiliuhomepage). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in computer science from Wuhan University in 2021. I was a visiting student at the University of California, Berkeley from January 2020 to June 2020. I interned at Sea AI Lab, Singapore from September 2022 to June 2023. 

My research primarily revolves around machine learning, specifically emphasizing trustworthy machine learning and multi-task learning.

- **Trustworthy:** [ICML'23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04638), [NeurIPS'22](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/a80ebbb4ec9e9b39789318a0a61e2e43-Abstract-Conference.html), [ICML'22](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/wang22q.html)
- **Multi-task learning in NLP:** [TKDE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9893398), [ACL findings'22](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.271), [ACL'21](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.428)
